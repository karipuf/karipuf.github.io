	      <span>Welcome to my homepage. I am currently an
	      Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at
	      </span> <a href="http://www.masdar.ac.ae/">Masdar
		Institute</a> <span>(MI), which was founded in
		collaboration with
		the <a href="http://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts
		Institute of Technology</a>. The Institute is located
		in</span> <a href="http://www.masdarcity.ae/">Masdar
		City</a> <span>in Abu Dhabi, which is designed to be
		the most environmentally sustainable city in the
		world.</span>

	      <span>I was a member of the founding
		cohort of faculty members, who spent the first year as
		Visiting Scholars at MIT in 2007/08. The first
		semester of classes at MI started in Fall
		2009.</span><br><br>
	      

	      In addition, the Insitute is a part
		of <a href="http://www.ku.ac.ae/">Khalifa University
		of Science and Technology</a>, which recently received
		the UAE's <a href='https://www.thenational.ae/uae/khalifa-university-scores-uae-s-best-ranking-ever-by-times-higher-education-1.625817'>highest
		ever rating, as well as fifth place in the MENA
		(Middle East and North African) region</a>, as
		determined by the
		<a href='https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/-1/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats'>2018
		Times Higher Education</a> World University Rankings.

	      <span>My current research interests include:</span><br>
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  <strong>Machine Learning and Analytics</strong> - in
		  general I'm interested in applying machine learning
		  techniques to solving problems which involve large,
		  complex sets of data. I have worked in numerous
		  difficult problems including human brain signal
		  analysis, technology forecasting and image
		  processing.
		</li>
		<li>
		  <strong>Text Mining</strong> - mining unstructured
		  data sets, particular text collections is
		  particularly interesting. My main interest in this
		  area is the analysis of academic abstract databases
		  to determine trends and patterns in technology and
		  science. This is sometimes called "Tech-Mining".
		</li>
		<li>
		  <strong>Smart Grid/Power System Applications of Data
		  Mining</strong> - "Smart Grid" is an increasingly
		  common term. There is no concrete definition but
		  most would agree on some notion of it being the next
		  generation power system which would involve a
		  combination of traditional infrastructure and modern
		  ICT ("smart") components. Any such system is likely
		  to be highly data intensive and data mining has an
		  important role to play. Our research thus far has
		  focused on designing protection algorithms which can
		  better detect faults in a power system -
		  particularly one powered by low current,
		  "distributed" devices (which is often the case with
		  renewable energy sources).
